# House Agents Examples

This directory contains practical examples of using house agents in real-world scenarios.

## Examples Overview

1. **security-audit.md** - Finding security issues in a codebase
2. **refactoring-workflow.md** - Multi-agent refactoring workflow
3. **api-integration.md** - Setting up external API integrations
4. **test-and-build.md** - Running tests and builds efficiently

## How to Use These Examples

Each example file contains:
- **Scenario**: The problem you're trying to solve
- **Commands**: Exact prompts to copy/paste into Claude Code
- **Expected Output**: What the agent should return
- **Next Steps**: What to do with the agent's results

## Testing These Examples

To test if your house agents are working correctly:

1. Install house agents in a test project
2. Follow the commands in any example file
3. Compare agent output with expected format
4. Verify token savings in Claude Code
