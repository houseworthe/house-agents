## Single Agent Usage

### House Research Examples

#### Example 1: Finding Security Issues

**You:**
```
Use house-research to find all instances where we're using eval() or innerHTML
```

**House Research Agent Returns:**
```
## Search Results: Potentially Unsafe Code Patterns

### Summary
Found 3 instances of eval() and 7 instances of innerHTML across the codebase.
Most are in legacy code, 2 require immediate attention.

### Key Findings

**1. Direct eval() usage (HIGH RISK)**
- Location: `src/utils/parser.js:42`
- Details: `eval(userInput)` - evaluating unsanitized user input
- Relevance: Critical security vulnerability

**2. innerHTML with user data**
- Location: `src/components/UserProfile.js:89`
- Details: `element.innerHTML = userData.bio` - XSS risk
- Relevance: User-supplied content rendered without sanitization

[... condensed results ...]

### Recommended Actions
1. Replace eval() in parser.js with JSON.parse()
2. Use textContent or DOMPurify for innerHTML cases
3. Audit remaining instances in legacy code
```

**Your Next Message:**
```
Replace the eval() in parser.js with a safe alternative
```

#### Example 2: Finding API Endpoints

**You:**
```
Use house-research to find all Express route definitions in the backend
```

**House Research Agent Returns:**
```
## Search Results: Express Routes

### Summary
Found 23 route definitions across 5 files. 12 GET, 8 POST, 3 DELETE routes.

### Key Findings by File

**src/routes/auth.js**
- `POST /api/auth/login` (line 15)
- `POST /api/auth/register` (line 32)
- `POST /api/auth/logout` (line 48)

**src/routes/users.js**
- `GET /api/users` (line 10)
- `GET /api/users/:id` (line 25)
- `PUT /api/users/:id` (line 42)
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` (line 67)

[... more routes ...]

### Patterns Observed
- Auth routes lack rate limiting
- User routes missing input validation middleware
- No API versioning (consider /v1/ prefix)

### Recommended Actions
1. Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
2. Implement input validation middleware
3. Consider API versioning strategy
```

---

### House Bash Examples

#### Example 1: Running Tests

**You:**
```
Use house-bash to run the test suite and analyze any failures
```

**House Bash Agent Returns:**
```
## Execution Results: Test Suite

### Status
‚ùå Failed - 3 tests failing

### Summary
Ran 47 tests in 2.3s. 44 passed, 3 failed. All failures in auth module.

### Commands Executed
1. `npm test`

### Key Results
- Total tests: 47
- Passed: 44 (93.6%)
- Failed: 3 (6.4%)
- Duration: 2.3 seconds

### Errors Found

**Error 1: JWT Token Validation**
```
FAIL src/auth/jwt.test.js
  ‚óè JWT verification ‚Ä∫ should reject expired tokens

  Expected expired token to be rejected, but was accepted

  at Object.<anonymous> (src/auth/jwt.test.js:45:7)
```
**Likely Cause**: JWT library not checking expiration or system clock issue
**Suggested Fix**:
1. Check if `jwt.verify()` has `ignoreExpiration: false` option
2. Verify system time is correct (`date` command)
3. Check if test tokens actually expired

**Error 2: Password Hashing**
```
FAIL src/auth/password.test.js
  ‚óè Password hashing ‚Ä∫ should generate different hashes for same password

  Expected different hashes but got identical results

  at Object.<anonymous> (src/auth/password.test.js:23:7)
```
**Likely Cause**: Salt not being generated or reused across calls
**Suggested Fix**: Ensure bcrypt.hash() generates new salt each time

**Error 3: Login Rate Limiting**
```
FAIL src/auth/rateLimit.test.js
  ‚óè Rate limiting ‚Ä∫ should block after 5 failed attempts

  Expected request to be blocked but got 200 response

  at Object.<anonymous> (src/auth/rateLimit.test.js:67:7)
```
**Likely Cause**: Rate limiter not properly configured or Redis not running
**Suggested Fix**: Check Redis connection and rate limiter middleware order

### Next Steps
1. Fix JWT expiration checking in auth/jwt.js
2. Review bcrypt salt generation in auth/password.js
3. Verify rate limiter configuration and Redis connection
4. Re-run tests after fixes
```

#### Example 2: Building and Analyzing Output

**You:**
```
Use house-bash to run the production build and check for issues
```

**House Bash Agent Returns:**
```
## Execution Results: Production Build

### Status
‚úÖ Success with warnings

### Summary
Build completed in 12.3s. Bundle size increased 15% from last build. 3 warnings found.

### Commands Executed
1. `npm run build`

### Key Results
- Build time: 12.3 seconds
- Output directory: dist/
- Main bundle: 245.3 KB (gzipped: 87.2 KB)
- Vendor bundle: 156.8 KB (gzipped: 52.1 KB)
- Total size: 402.1 KB

### Warnings Found

**Warning 1: Large Bundle Size**
```
WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit (244 KiB).
  main.js (245.3 KiB)
```
**Suggested Fix**: Consider code splitting or dynamic imports for large dependencies

**Warning 2: Deprecated API Usage**
```
WARNING in ./src/utils/api.js
Module Warning (from ./node_modules/eslint-loader/index.js):
  axios.get() 'transformResponse' option is deprecated
```
**Suggested Fix**: Update to axios v1.0+ API or remove deprecated options

**Warning 3: Source Map Size**
```
WARNING in source-map-loader
Failed to parse source map from 'node_modules/some-package/dist/file.js'
```
**Suggested Fix**: Non-critical - third-party package issue, safe to ignore

### Output Highlights
```
‚úì Built in 12.3s
‚úì 23 modules transformed
‚úì Build artifacts written to dist/

Bundle Analysis:
‚îú‚îÄ main.js (245.3 KB)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ React (45 KB)

### House MCP Examples

#### Example 1: Configuring an MCP Server

**You:**
```
Use house-mcp to help me configure the Context7 MCP server for library documentation
```

**House MCP Agent Returns:**
```
## Context7 MCP Server Config

**Summary:** Access library documentation directly in Claude Code using Context7 MCP server.

**Configuration (.mcp.json):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@context7/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Usage:**
```
Ask Claude: "Use context7 to get React hooks documentation"
Or: "Look up Next.js routing in context7"
```

**Critical Notes:**
- No API key required - uses public documentation
- Restart Claude Code after adding config
- Works with 1000+ popular libraries

**Need more?** Ask about: specific libraries, version selection, caching
```

#### Example 2: General API Configuration

**You:**
```
Use house-mcp to generate a SendGrid email integration config
```

**House MCP Agent Returns:**
```
## SendGrid Email Integration

**Summary:** Send transactional emails via SendGrid API with Node.js

**Code:**
```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

async function sendEmail(to, subject, html) {
  await sgMail.send({
    to,
    from: 'noreply@yourdomain.com', // Must be verified
    subject,
    html
  });
}
```

**Usage:**
```javascript
await sendEmail(
  'user@example.com',
  'Welcome!',
  '<h1>Thanks for signing up</h1>'
);
```

**Critical Notes:**
- Verify sender email in SendGrid dashboard first
- Never commit API keys (use environment variables)
- Free tier: 100 emails/day

**Need more?** Ask about: templates, attachments, tracking, webhooks
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Search ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Test

Best for: Bug fixes, code cleanup

```
1. "Use house-research to find all instances of [problem]"
2. [Make fixes]
3. "Use house-bash to run tests and verify fixes"
```

### Pattern 2: Research ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Deploy

Best for: New features, integrations

```
1. "Use house-research to find examples of [integration/pattern]"
2. [Implement the feature with main Claude]
3. "Use house-bash to build and deploy"
```

### Pattern 3: Audit ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Implement

Best for: Large refactors, security reviews

```
1. "Use house-research to analyze the [system/module]"
2. [Review findings and plan changes]
3. "Use house-research to find similar patterns in other files"
4. [Implement changes across codebase]
5. "Use house-bash to run full test suite"
```

### Pattern 4: Pre-Merge Review

Best for: Code review, merge safety checks

```
1. "Use house-git to compare feature-branch with main"
2. [Review critical changes identified]
3. "Use house-bash to run tests on feature-branch"
4. [Make merge decision]
```

## Anti-Patterns

### ‚ùå Don't: Use for Simple Tasks

**Bad:**
```
Use house-research to read the auth.js file
```

**Good:**
```
Read src/auth/auth.js
```

*Why:* Single file reads don't need a sub-agent

---

### ‚ùå Don't: Chain Too Many Agents

**Bad:**
```
Use house-research to find X, then use house-bash to test Y,
then use house-git to review Z, then use house-research to verify...
```

**Good:**
```
Use house-research to find X
[Review results, make decisions]
Use house-bash to test the changes
```

*Why:* Too many agent calls add latency. Let main Claude coordinate.

---

### ‚ùå Don't: Over-Specify Agent Tasks

**Bad:**
```
Use house-research to search for the word "async" in files matching
*.js pattern in the src directory, excluding node_modules, and return
results grouped by file
```

**Good:**
```
Use house-research to find all async functions in src/
```

*Why:* Let the agent determine search strategy. They're experts.

---

### ‚ùå Don't: Use When You Need Full Context

**Bad:**
```
Use house-research to help me understand how the auth system works
```

**Good:**
```
Explain how the authentication system in src/auth/ works
```

*Why:* Main Claude is better for explanations and learning. House agents are for heavy operations.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific About Goals**
   - ‚úÖ "Find all React components with memory leaks"
   - ‚ùå "Find React stuff"

2. **Let Agents Finish Before Next Step**
   - Review agent results before making decisions
   - Don't chain 5 agents in one message

3. **Use the Right Agent**
   - Searching files? ‚Üí house-research
   - Analyzing git changes? ‚Üí house-git
   - Running commands? ‚Üí house-bash

4. **Trust Agent Expertise**
   - They know which tools to use
   - They know how to condense results
   - Review their work, but don't micromanage

5. **Iterate When Needed**
   - If agent returns too much: "Focus on files modified in last month"
   - If agent returns too little: "Also check the test files"

## Getting Help

Having issues with house agents?

1. Check agent files for tool permissions
2. Verify you're using the right agent for the task
3. Try being more specific in your request
4. Break complex tasks into smaller steps

Remember: House agents are specialized workers, not replacements for main Claude. Use them for heavy operations, let main Claude handle coordination and implementation.
